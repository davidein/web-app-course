# Sublime Text 2

Sublime is an excellent light-weight editor for small to medium sized projects. It is also great for quickly opening random files, even just for reading. It can be extended and configured in many ways.

Oh, and did I mention that it is also cross-platform and there is no time or feature limit in the trial.

## Get it

Download it here:

http://www.sublimetext.com

Also, while you're there, read about some of the cool features it supports. Multiple Selections, Goto Anything, Split Editing and more.

## Symbolic link

If you use command line a lot. I recommend finding a way to make a symbolic link to the app, like `subl`.

## Sublime Package Control

After that's done, go get Sublime Package Control:

http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation

To install it, open the console in sublime (View->Show Console), and paste the huge command into the console. You'll need to restart the editor after it's finished.

## Nice packages

When you have the package control, just press Shift-Command-P and type `install` to find `Package Control: Install Package`. There you can find the following packages and more.

* CoffeeScript
* DocBlockr
* Sass
* SublimeLinter
